This is my Restaurant Page Project.
The goal is to use JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website (styling still done in a separate CSS file).

run "npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev" to install dependencies.

NOTE TO SELF: use "npx webpack --watch" so you do not have to rerun webpack everytime you make a change (use ctrl + c to exit the watch).

Based around curriculum from the Odin Project. https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page
